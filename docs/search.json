Our nationwide audit shows that while Black and White constituents receive similar baseline responsiveness from local policymakers, cues about institutional conditions in constituent messages can reconfigure who gets attention and whether attention becomes commitment. Appeals to broad public concern can open doors for Black constituents yet simultaneously steer policymakers away from substantive engagement. We demonstrate this dynamic in police misconduct settlements—quiet payouts that strain municipal budgets and bypass police accountability. Yet the mechanisms we uncover should travel beyond policing. By showing how micro-level race-based gatekeeping is conditioned by macro-level institutional conditions, we highlight both the promise and peril of public pressure as a strategy to broaden minority access to policy agenda.\n\n\n\nFor-Profit Fundraisers Make Nonprofits Market-Focused in Donors’ Eyes. with Kenneth Meier.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe tension between social mission and organizational efficiency in nonprofit organizations is evident in various operational practices, particularly fundraising. In pursuit of greater efficiency, some nonprofits outsource this critical function to professional fundraising consultants, who are often for-profit entities. However, prior research on sector stereotypes suggests that the public tends to view business-like or profit-seeking practices in social services negatively. Consequently, hiring for-profit fundraisers may backfire for nonprofits. We test this hypothesis through a preregistered online experiment. The results show that donor contributions did not significantly decrease when a for-profit professional fundraiser represented a nonprofit nursing home, even under an aggressive pricing strategy. However, the use of a for-profit fundraiser led participants to perceive the nonprofit as more market-oriented than the typical nonprofit. We discuss the implications of this shift in public perceptions.\n\n\n\nBureaucratic Responsiveness, Immigrants, and Environmental Justice: Evidence from an Experimental Study. with Jiaqi Liang; Zhengyan Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThrough the U.S. Superfund program, which is designed to clean up the most contaminated sites in the country, we test bureaucratic responsiveness with an audit experiment examining whether government officials show disparities in responding to residents based on the latter’s nativity, race/ethnicity, and language usage. Using 622 emails to federal Superfund managers, we found no significant differences based on nativity or race alone. However, we discovered substantial language-based disparities: managers were 12.7 percentage points less likely to respond to emails written in Spanish compared to those in English. These findings reveal that variations in access to information and participation opportunities from government agencies are largely attributable to whether residents communicate using the dominant language in society, rather than to racial or nativity status alone. This research advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving bureaucrat-citizen interactions, with important implications for administrative capacity building in increasingly diverse communities.\n\n\n\nThe Cost of Service and Street-level Bureaucrats’ Coping Strategy: A Field Experiment. with Jiaqi Liang; Sanghee Park.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis study explores how workload and representation influence government officials’ responses to public inquiries. Public inquiries serve as a formal tool for citizens to raise concerns, request information, and hold government accountable, while also serving as a communication channel between bureaucrats and citizens. Using a correspondence experiment, we examine whether public managers in the U.S. Superfund program respond, and if so, how their responses vary across the levels of perceived administrative efforts demanded by the inquiries and the demographic congruence between the manager and the citizen-requesters. We find that bureaucrats are significantly more likely to respond to low-workload requests, consistent with the street-level coping behavior, and female managers are more sensitive to perceived workload. The positive effect of gender matching is not observed for both responsiveness and willingness to engage with the resident who submitted the inquiry. However, we find a modest but robust effect of gender incongruence, suggesting that managers are more willing to engage with requesters of the opposite gender once they commit to respond.\n\n\n\nDesigning a More Inclusive Government Grantmaking Process: Perspectives from Nonprofit Leaders in Minnesota. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter; Kari Aanestad.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEach year, the state of Minnesota administers hundreds of millions of dollars in the nonprofit sector via government grant programs. While nonprofits play important roles in ensuring the effective implementation of these programs and amplifying the voices of community members, they face significant barriers in the government grantmaking process. These barriers are especially challenging for small, rural, and BIPOC-serving nonprofits. Leveraging a research-practice partnership and a survey of 327 nonprofit leaders in Minnesota (78% of our nonprofit respondents have applied for or received a state government grant at least once in the past 5 years), we provide the answers to the following two questions: (1) What key barriers are nonprofits experiencing in the government grant-making process? (2) What elements of the government grant request for proposals (RFPs) impact nonprofits’ intention to apply for such programs?\n\n\n\nLinking Decision Roles to Knowledge Utilization in U.S. State Governments: A Mixed-Method Study. with Shuping Wang; Yuan-Daniel Cheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe contemporary evidence-based policymaking movement argues that we need more scientific evidence or knowledge for civil servants to make better decisions. However, how civil servants rely on different types of knowledge to make decision, and how much weight they put on each type of knowledge is not clear. Furthermore, recent discussions on street-level bureaucrats also provide insights into how personal experience can help civil servants make better decisions. Using survey data from 259 civil servants and 36 semi-structured interviews from three state governments, this article employs a mixed-method approach to understand how civil servants strategically use different knowledge to respond to different role requirements from multiple institutional logics. The results suggest that civil servants in policy, legislative relations, and budgeting roles value political knowledge more than other civil servants, while civil servants in contracting roles value personal knowledge more. No role prioritizes scientific knowledge more than the other roles. Using information from our qualitative interviews, we further discuss the reasons why civil servants in some roles value various types of knowledge more than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT Models for Text Annotation: An Empirical Exploration in Public Policy Research (2025. Policy Studies Journal). with Alexander Churchill; Shamitha Pichika; Ying Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nText annotation, the practice of labeling text following a predetermined scheme, is essential to qualitative public policy research. Despite its importance, annotating large qualitative data faces challenges of high labor and time costs. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), specifically models with generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), show a potential approach that may alleviate the burden of manual text annotation. In this report, we first introduce a small sample pretest strategy for researchers to decide whether to use Open AI’s GPT models for text annotation. In addition, we test if GPT models can substitute human coders by comparing the results of two GPT models with different prompting strategies against human annotation. Using email messages collected from a national corresponding experiment in the US nursing home market as an example, on average, we demonstrate 86.25% percentage agreement between GPT and human annotations. We also show that GPT models possess context-based limitations. Our report ends with reflections and suggestions for readers who are interested in using GPT models for text annotation.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nInformation Cost and Charitable Giving (2025). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly (Online first). with George Mitchell; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nDonors may be unwilling to acquire information about nonprofit performance when doing so is costly, potentially limiting charitable giving and weakening incentives for nonprofit accountability. This article examines how information costs shape donation decisions and evaluates whether reducing those costs increases giving. Using experimental evidence, we show that when performance information is easy to obtain, donors are more likely to consider it and adjust their giving accordingly. Conversely, higher information costs reduce attention to performance signals and attenuate responsiveness. We discuss implications for nonprofit transparency, information intermediaries, and fundraising strategies that lower donors’ search and processing burdens.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nNo Country for Model Minorities: Evidence of Discrimination Against Asian Noncitizen Immigrants in the U.S. Nursing Home Market (2025). Public Administration Review, 85(5), 1347–1364. with Danbee Lee.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAlthough public administration scholars have long been concerned about equity in public service delivery, evidence on discrimination against Asian noncitizen immigrants remains limited. Drawing on theories of social categorization and intergroup bias, this study tests whether nursing homes discriminate against Asian noncitizen applicants. We conduct a correspondence experiment in which inquiries from prospective residents vary by implied race/ethnicity and citizenship status. Results show that Asian noncitizen immigrants receive fewer and less helpful responses than comparable applicants, indicating discrimination in access to long-term care information. The findings highlight an overlooked dimension of inequity and suggest the need for oversight and policy interventions to ensure fair access to care.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEvaluating Use of Evidence in U.S. State Governments: A Conjoint Analysis (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(4), 1217–1235. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Shuping Wang; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEvidence‐based practice (EBP) has become a global movement, yet we know comparatively little about how civil servants evaluate evidence in decision making. We use a conjoint experiment embedded in a multi-state survey of state government employees to examine which features of evidence increase its perceived usefulness. Respondents evaluated short evidence summaries that randomly varied on attributes such as methodological rigor, relevance, timeliness, source credibility, and presentation format. Results show that credibility and relevance substantially shape perceived usefulness, while certain technical features have weaker or heterogeneous effects. The study clarifies what “counts” as evidence for public officials and offers practical lessons for researchers and intermediaries aiming to increase evidence uptake in government.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnderstanding the Use of Evidence-based Practices by Civil Servants in U.S. State Governments: Current State, Challenges and Pathways Forward (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(1), 9–20. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Leslie Thompson; Shuping Wang; Jules Marzec; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLeveraging a three-state survey of 323 civil servants, this study examines the current state of evidence-based practice (EBP) use in state governments, identifies common barriers, and considers pathways for strengthening evidence use. We document patterns of evidence engagement across agencies and roles, highlighting constraints such as limited time, misalignment between available evidence and policy needs, and organizational factors that shape access and incentives. We also explore how training, leadership support, and institutional infrastructure relate to evidence use. Findings inform ongoing efforts to build evidence-informed policymaking capacity and suggest concrete strategies for improving the supply, accessibility, and applicability of evidence in state government contexts.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCommunal-Focused or Market-Focused: Moral Judgment on Business Practices in Nonprofit Organizations (2023). Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 34(3), 629–655.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofit organizations increasingly adopt business practices, yet such practices may elicit moral concerns because nonprofits are expected to prioritize communal goals. This study examines how observers morally judge nonprofit business practices and whether judgments depend on whether practices signal communal focus or market focus. Using survey experiments, we show that market-focused cues trigger stronger moral disapproval and reduce perceived legitimacy relative to communal-focused cues. The findings illuminate a moral dimension of nonprofit hybridity and suggest that how nonprofits communicate and frame business practices can shape stakeholder evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nDe-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation (2023). International Public Management Journal, 26(1), 107–125. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPerformance information can be interpreted through stereotypes about social groups, potentially biasing public performance evaluation. This study investigates whether and how de-stereotyping interventions affect citizens’ judgments when evaluating performance outcomes linked to stereotyped groups. Using experimental designs, we show that stereotypes can systematically shape perceived performance and support for public organizations. However, providing individuating information or reframing cues can reduce reliance on stereotypes and improve evaluative fairness. The results highlight a psychological mechanism behind biased performance assessment and point to actionable strategies to mitigate inequities in citizen evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEverything hacked? What is the Evidential Value of the Experimental Public Administration Literature? (2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–17. with Dominik Vogel.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nConcerns about publication bias and questionable research practices have raised questions about the credibility of experimental findings across disciplines. This article evaluates the evidential value of the experimental public administration literature using statistical tools designed to detect selective reporting and assess robustness. We analyze published experiments and examine patterns of reported p-values and effect sizes. The results suggest that while many studies provide evidential value, there are also signs consistent with selective reporting in some areas. We discuss implications for research transparency and propose practices to strengthen the reliability and cumulative progress of experimental public administration research.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nDoes Mislabeling COVID-19 Elicit the Perception of Threat and Reduce Blame? (2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–13. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPolitical and media actors sometimes use labels for infectious diseases that emphasize geographic or ethnic associations. This study examines whether mislabeling COVID-19 influences perceived threat and attribution of blame. Using experimental survey evidence, we test how different disease labels affect attitudes toward groups associated with the label, threat perceptions, and policy preferences. Findings show that mislabeling can increase perceived threat and alter blame dynamics, with implications for social cohesion and crisis communication. The study contributes to understanding how language shapes public reactions during public health emergencies.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nResource Publicness Matters in Organizational Perceptions (2021). Public Administration Review, 82(2), 338–353. with Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPublic, nonprofit, and private organizations often rely on different combinations of funding sources, which may shape how stakeholders perceive them. This study develops and tests the concept of resource publicness and examines how funding composition influences organizational perceptions. Using experimental evidence, we show that higher resource publicness affects perceptions of legitimacy, accountability, and mission orientation. The findings advance theories of sector distinctions and provide insight into how organizations can manage stakeholder expectations through financial transparency and communication.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnpacking Nonprofit Autonomy-Interdependence Paradox in Collaborative Relationships (2021). American Review of Public Administration, 51(4), 308–324. with Mirae Kim.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofits frequently collaborate with governments and other partners, gaining resources while risking reduced autonomy. This article examines the autonomy–interdependence paradox in nonprofit collaborative relationships and identifies conditions under which collaboration undermines or supports nonprofit autonomy. Using empirical analyses, we show that different forms of dependence and governance arrangements can have distinct effects. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of collaboration tradeoffs and provide guidance for designing partnerships that balance resource benefits with nonprofit independence.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nMessenger Effects in COVID-19 Communication: Does the Level of Government Matter? (2020). Health Policy OPEN, 100027. with Nathan Favero; Sebastian Jilke; Julia A. Wolfson; Matthew Young.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEffective crisis communication can depend not only on message content but also on who delivers the message. This study examines messenger effects in COVID-19 communication, focusing on whether the level of government (local, state, federal) influences public responses. Using survey experiments, we test how messenger cues shape trust, perceived credibility, and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that messenger effects vary across contexts and may interact with political attitudes. The findings inform public health communication strategies and highlight the importance of messenger selection in emergency messaging.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nThe Perceived Differences: The Sector Stereotypes of Social Service Providers (2020). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 49(6), 1293–1310.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nSector stereotypes can shape how people perceive social service providers and evaluate their performance, even when services are similar. This article examines stereotypes about nonprofit versus government providers and how such perceptions influence judgments. Using experimental designs, we show that sector labels can trigger systematic expectations about compassion, efficiency, and trustworthiness. These stereotypes affect support and evaluations of service outcomes. The study advances understanding of how sector identities influence public opinion and has implications for service branding, contracting, and accountability.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nPhilanthropy Can Be Learned: A Qualitative Study of Student Experiences in Experiential Philanthropy Courses (2019). Philanthropy and Education, 2(2), 29–52. with Huafang Li; Lindsey McDougle.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nExperiential philanthropy courses aim to teach students about philanthropy by involving them in real grantmaking decisions. This qualitative study examines student experiences in such courses and identifies learning outcomes and challenges. Findings suggest that students develop increased understanding of nonprofit work, donor decision making, and community needs, while also encountering tensions related to values, evidence, and accountability. The study offers insights for designing experiential philanthropy pedagogy and contributes to broader conversations about civic learning and philanthropic education.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUsing Large Scale Social Media Experiments in Public Administration: Assessing Charitable Consequences of Government Funding to Nonprofits (2019). Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 29(4), 627–639. with Sebastian Jilke; Jiahuan Lu; Shugo Shinohara.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nGovernment funding can influence public perceptions of nonprofits and potentially affect private donations. This study uses large-scale social media experiments to examine how information about government funding to nonprofits shapes charitable behavior. We test messaging interventions and measure donation-related outcomes, assessing whether government support crowds out or crowds in private giving. Results indicate that funding cues can have meaningful effects, depending on framing and audience characteristics. The study demonstrates the promise of social media experiments for public administration research and provides evidence on the charitable consequences of government–nonprofit financial relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nComplementary or Supplementary? The Relationship between Government Size and Nonprofit Sector Size (2018). VOLUNTAS, 29(3), 454–469. with Jiahuan Lu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe relationship between government size and nonprofit sector size is debated: larger governments may either crowd out nonprofits (substitution) or foster nonprofit growth (complementarity). This article examines cross-national evidence on how government scale relates to nonprofit sector size, considering theoretical mechanisms and contextual factors. Findings suggest that government and nonprofit sectors can be complementary in many settings, though relationships vary depending on policy domains and institutional environments. The study contributes to comparative nonprofit research and informs discussions about state–civil society relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCan Philanthropy be Taught? (2017). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 46(2), 330–351. with Lindsey McDougle; D. McDonald; W. McIntyre Miller; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nInterest in teaching philanthropy has grown, but evidence about whether and how philanthropic attitudes and behaviors can be shaped through education is limited. This article examines experiential philanthropy courses and evaluates whether participation influences students’ philanthropic knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Using empirical data, we find that experiential approaches can improve understanding and engagement, though effects vary across student groups and course designs. The study provides evidence that philanthropy can be taught and offers recommendations for philanthropic education and civic engagement pedagogy.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic Pressure Expands Policy Access for Black Constituents but Limits Substantive Engagement. with Danyao Li; Yixin Liu; Huimin Zheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nMunicipal policymakers are gatekeepers of policy ideas.

This study examines messenger effects in COVID-19 communication, focusing on whether the level of government (local, state, federal) influences public responses. Using survey experiments, we test how messenger cues shape trust, perceived credibility, and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that messenger effects vary across contexts and may interact with political attitudes. The findings inform public health communication strategies and highlight the importance of messenger selection in emergency messaging.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor-Profit Fundraisers Make Nonprofits Market-Focused in Donors’ Eyes. with Kenneth Meier.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe tension between social mission and organizational efficiency in nonprofit organizations is evident in various operational practices, particularly fundraising. In pursuit of greater efficiency, some nonprofits outsource this critical function to professional fundraising consultants, who are often for-profit entities. However, prior research on sector stereotypes suggests that the public tends to view business-like or profit-seeking practices in social services negatively. Consequently, hiring for-profit fundraisers may backfire for nonprofits. We test this hypothesis through a preregistered online experiment. The results show that donor contributions did not significantly decrease when a for-profit professional fundraiser represented a nonprofit nursing home, even under an aggressive pricing strategy. However, the use of a for-profit fundraiser led participants to perceive the nonprofit as more market-oriented than the typical nonprofit. We discuss the implications of this shift in public perceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Cost and Charitable Giving (2025). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly (Online first). with George Mitchell; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nDonors may be unwilling to acquire information about nonprofit performance when doing so is costly, potentially limiting charitable giving and weakening incentives for nonprofit accountability. This article examines how information costs shape donation decisions and evaluates whether reducing those costs increases giving. Using experimental evidence, we show that when performance information is easy to obtain, donors are more likely to consider it and adjust their giving accordingly. Conversely, higher information costs reduce attention to performance signals and attenuate responsiveness. We discuss implications for nonprofit transparency, information intermediaries, and fundraising strategies that lower donors’ search and processing burdens.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCommunal-Focused or Market-Focused: Moral Judgment on Business Practices in Nonprofit Organizations (2023). Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 34(3), 629–655.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofit organizations increasingly adopt business practices, yet such practices may elicit moral concerns because nonprofits are expected to prioritize communal goals. This study examines how observers morally judge nonprofit business practices and whether judgments depend on whether practices signal communal focus or market focus. Using survey experiments, we show that market-focused cues trigger stronger moral disapproval and reduce perceived legitimacy relative to communal-focused cues. The findings illuminate a moral dimension of nonprofit hybridity and suggest that how nonprofits communicate and frame business practices can shape stakeholder evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnpacking Nonprofit Autonomy-Interdependence Paradox in Collaborative Relationships (2021). American Review of Public Administration, 51(4), 308–324. with Mirae Kim.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofits frequently collaborate with governments and other partners, gaining resources while risking reduced autonomy. This article examines the autonomy–interdependence paradox in nonprofit collaborative relationships and identifies conditions under which collaboration undermines or supports nonprofit autonomy. Using empirical analyses, we show that different forms of dependence and governance arrangements can have distinct effects. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of collaboration tradeoffs and provide guidance for designing partnerships that balance resource benefits with nonprofit independence.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nThe Perceived Differences: The Sector Stereotypes of Social Service Providers (2020). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 49(6), 1293–1310.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nSector stereotypes can shape how people perceive social service providers and evaluate their performance, even when services are similar. This article examines stereotypes about nonprofit versus government providers and how such perceptions influence judgments. Using experimental designs, we show that sector labels can trigger systematic expectations about compassion, efficiency, and trustworthiness. These stereotypes affect support and evaluations of service outcomes. The study advances understanding of how sector identities influence public opinion and has implications for service branding, contracting, and accountability.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nPhilanthropy Can Be Learned: A Qualitative Study of Student Experiences in Experiential Philanthropy Courses (2019). Philanthropy and Education, 2(2), 29–52. with Huafang Li; Lindsey McDougle.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nExperiential philanthropy courses aim to teach students about philanthropy by involving them in real grantmaking decisions. This qualitative study examines student experiences in such courses and identifies learning outcomes and challenges. Findings suggest that students develop increased understanding of nonprofit work, donor decision making, and community needs, while also encountering tensions related to values, evidence, and accountability. The study offers insights for designing experiential philanthropy pedagogy and contributes to broader conversations about civic learning and philanthropic education.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUsing Large Scale Social Media Experiments in Public Administration: Assessing Charitable Consequences of Government Funding to Nonprofits (2019). Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 29(4), 627–639. with Sebastian Jilke; Jiahuan Lu; Shugo Shinohara.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nGovernment funding can influence public perceptions of nonprofits and potentially affect private donations. This study uses large-scale social media experiments to examine how information about government funding to nonprofits shapes charitable behavior. We test messaging interventions and measure donation-related outcomes, assessing whether government support crowds out or crowds in private giving. Results indicate that funding cues can have meaningful effects, depending on framing and audience characteristics. The study demonstrates the promise of social media experiments for public administration research and provides evidence on the charitable consequences of government–nonprofit financial relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nComplementary or Supplementary? The Relationship between Government Size and Nonprofit Sector Size (2018). VOLUNTAS, 29(3), 454–469. with Jiahuan Lu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe relationship between government size and nonprofit sector size is debated: larger governments may either crowd out nonprofits (substitution) or foster nonprofit growth (complementarity). This article examines cross-national evidence on how government scale relates to nonprofit sector size, considering theoretical mechanisms and contextual factors. Findings suggest that government and nonprofit sectors can be complementary in many settings, though relationships vary depending on policy domains and institutional environments. The study contributes to comparative nonprofit research and informs discussions about state–civil society relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCan Philanthropy be Taught? (2017). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 46(2), 330–351. with Lindsey McDougle; D. McDonald; W. McIntyre Miller; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nInterest in teaching philanthropy has grown, but evidence about whether and how philanthropic attitudes and behaviors can be shaped through education is limited. This article examines experiential philanthropy courses and evaluates whether participation influences students’ philanthropic knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Using empirical data, we find that experiential approaches can improve understanding and engagement, though effects vary across student groups and course designs. The study provides evidence that philanthropy can be taught and offers recommendations for philanthropic education and civic engagement pedagogy.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking Decision Roles to Knowledge Utilization in U.S. State Governments: A Mixed-Method Study. with Shuping Wang; Yuan-Daniel Cheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe contemporary evidence-based policymaking movement argues that we need more scientific evidence or knowledge for civil servants to make better decisions. However, how civil servants rely on different types of knowledge to make decision, and how much weight they put on each type of knowledge is not clear. Furthermore, recent discussions on street-level bureaucrats also provide insights into how personal experience can help civil servants make better decisions. Using survey data from 259 civil servants and 36 semi-structured interviews from three state governments, this article employs a mixed-method approach to understand how civil servants strategically use different knowledge to respond to different role requirements from multiple institutional logics. The results suggest that civil servants in policy, legislative relations, and budgeting roles value political knowledge more than other civil servants, while civil servants in contracting roles value personal knowledge more. No role prioritizes scientific knowledge more than the other roles. Using information from our qualitative interviews, we further discuss the reasons why civil servants in some roles value various types of knowledge more than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPT Models for Text Annotation: An Empirical Exploration in Public Policy Research (2025. Policy Studies Journal). with Alexander Churchill; Shamitha Pichika; Ying Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nText annotation, the practice of labeling text following a predetermined scheme, is essential to qualitative public policy research. Despite its importance, annotating large qualitative data faces challenges of high labor and time costs. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), specifically models with generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), show a potential approach that may alleviate the burden of manual text annotation. In this report, we first introduce a small sample pretest strategy for researchers to decide whether to use Open AI’s GPT models for text annotation. In addition, we test if GPT models can substitute human coders by comparing the results of two GPT models with different prompting strategies against human annotation. Using email messages collected from a national corresponding experiment in the US nursing home market as an example, on average, we demonstrate 86.25% percentage agreement between GPT and human annotations. We also show that GPT models possess context-based limitations. Our report ends with reflections and suggestions for readers who are interested in using GPT models for text annotation.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nDe-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation (2023). International Public Management Journal, 26(1), 107–125. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPerformance information can be interpreted through stereotypes about social groups, potentially biasing public performance evaluation. This study investigates whether and how de-stereotyping interventions affect citizens’ judgments when evaluating performance outcomes linked to stereotyped groups. Using experimental designs, we show that stereotypes can systematically shape perceived performance and support for public organizations. However, providing individuating information or reframing cues can reduce reliance on stereotypes and improve evaluative fairness. The results highlight a psychological mechanism behind biased performance assessment and point to actionable strategies to mitigate inequities in citizen evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEverything hacked? What is the Evidential Value of the Experimental Public Administration Literature? (2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–17. with Dominik Vogel.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nConcerns about publication bias and questionable research practices have raised questions about the credibility of experimental findings across disciplines. This article evaluates the evidential value of the experimental public administration literature using statistical tools designed to detect selective reporting and assess robustness. We analyze published experiments and examine patterns of reported p-values and effect sizes. The results suggest that while many studies provide evidential value, there are also signs consistent with selective reporting in some areas. We discuss implications for research transparency and propose practices to strengthen the reliability and cumulative progress of experimental public administration research.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n:::"

Our nationwide audit shows that while Black and White constituents receive similar baseline responsiveness from local policymakers, cues about institutional conditions in constituent messages can reconfigure who gets attention and whether attention becomes commitment. Appeals to broad public concern can open doors for Black constituents yet simultaneously steer policymakers away from substantive engagement. We demonstrate this dynamic in police misconduct settlements—quiet payouts that strain municipal budgets and bypass police accountability. Yet the mechanisms we uncover should travel beyond policing. By showing how micro-level race-based gatekeeping is conditioned by macro-level institutional conditions, we highlight both the promise and peril of public pressure as a strategy to broaden minority access to policy agenda.\n\n\n\nFor-Profit Fundraisers Make Nonprofits Market-Focused in Donors’ Eyes. with Kenneth Meier.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe tension between social mission and organizational efficiency in nonprofit organizations is evident in various operational practices, particularly fundraising.

Using 622 emails to federal Superfund managers, we found no significant differences based on nativity or race alone. However, we discovered substantial language-based disparities: managers were 12.7 percentage points less likely to respond to emails written in Spanish compared to those in English. These findings reveal that variations in access to information and participation opportunities from government agencies are largely attributable to whether residents communicate using the dominant language in society, rather than to racial or nativity status alone. This research advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving bureaucrat-citizen interactions, with important implications for administrative capacity building in increasingly diverse communities.\n\n\n\nThe Cost of Service and Street-level Bureaucrats’ Coping Strategy: A Field Experiment. with Jiaqi Liang; Sanghee Park.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis study explores how workload and representation influence government officials’ responses to public inquiries. Public inquiries serve as a formal tool for citizens to raise concerns, request information, and hold government accountable, while also serving as a communication channel between bureaucrats and citizens. Using a correspondence experiment, we examine whether public managers in the U.S. Superfund program respond, and if so, how their responses vary across the levels of perceived administrative efforts demanded by the inquiries and the demographic congruence between the manager and the citizen-requesters. We find that bureaucrats are significantly more likely to respond to low-workload requests, consistent with the street-level coping behavior, and female managers are more sensitive to perceived workload. The positive effect of gender matching is not observed for both responsiveness and willingness to engage with the resident who submitted the inquiry. However, we find a modest but robust effect of gender incongruence, suggesting that managers are more willing to engage with requesters of the opposite gender once they commit to respond.\n\n\n\nDesigning a More Inclusive Government Grantmaking Process: Perspectives from Nonprofit Leaders in Minnesota. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter; Kari Aanestad.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEach year, the state of Minnesota administers hundreds of millions of dollars in the nonprofit sector via government grant programs. While nonprofits play important roles in ensuring the effective implementation of these programs and amplifying the voices of community members, they face significant barriers in the government grantmaking process. These barriers are especially challenging for small, rural, and BIPOC-serving nonprofits. Leveraging a research-practice partnership and a survey of 327 nonprofit leaders in Minnesota (78% of our nonprofit respondents have applied for or received a state government grant at least once in the past 5 years), we provide the answers to the following two questions: (1) What key barriers are nonprofits experiencing in the government grant-making process? (2) What elements of the government grant request for proposals (RFPs) impact nonprofits’ intention to apply for such programs?\n\n\n\nLinking Decision Roles to Knowledge Utilization in U.S. State Governments: A Mixed-Method Study. with Shuping Wang; Yuan-Daniel Cheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe contemporary evidence-based policymaking movement argues that we need more scientific evidence or knowledge for civil servants to make better decisions.

Public Administration Review, 85(5), 1347–1364. with Danbee Lee.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAlthough public administration scholars have long been concerned about equity in public service delivery, evidence on discrimination against Asian noncitizen immigrants remains limited. Drawing on theories of social categorization and intergroup bias, this study tests whether nursing homes discriminate against Asian noncitizen applicants. We conduct a correspondence experiment in which inquiries from prospective residents vary by implied race/ethnicity and citizenship status. Results show that Asian noncitizen immigrants receive fewer and less helpful responses than comparable applicants, indicating discrimination in access to long-term care information. The findings highlight an overlooked dimension of inequity and suggest the need for oversight and policy interventions to ensure fair access to care.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEvaluating Use of Evidence in U.S. State Governments: A Conjoint Analysis (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(4), 1217–1235. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Shuping Wang; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEvidence‐based practice (EBP) has become a global movement, yet we know comparatively little about how civil servants evaluate evidence in decision making. We use a conjoint experiment embedded in a multi-state survey of state government employees to examine which features of evidence increase its perceived usefulness. Respondents evaluated short evidence summaries that randomly varied on attributes such as methodological rigor, relevance, timeliness, source credibility, and presentation format. Results show that credibility and relevance substantially shape perceived usefulness, while certain technical features have weaker or heterogeneous effects. The study clarifies what “counts” as evidence for public officials and offers practical lessons for researchers and intermediaries aiming to increase evidence uptake in government.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnderstanding the Use of Evidence-based Practices by Civil Servants in U.S. State Governments: Current State, Challenges and Pathways Forward (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(1), 9–20. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Leslie Thompson; Shuping Wang; Jules Marzec; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLeveraging a three-state survey of 323 civil servants, this study examines the current state of evidence-based practice (EBP) use in state governments, identifies common barriers, and considers pathways for strengthening evidence use. We document patterns of evidence engagement across agencies and roles, highlighting constraints such as limited time, misalignment between available evidence and policy needs, and organizational factors that shape access and incentives. We also explore how training, leadership support, and institutional infrastructure relate to evidence use. Findings inform ongoing efforts to build evidence-informed policymaking capacity and suggest concrete strategies for improving the supply, accessibility, and applicability of evidence in state government contexts.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCommunal-Focused or Market-Focused: Moral Judgment on Business Practices in Nonprofit Organizations (2023).

(2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–13. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPolitical and media actors sometimes use labels for infectious diseases that emphasize geographic or ethnic associations. This study examines whether mislabeling COVID-19 influences perceived threat and attribution of blame. Using experimental survey evidence, we test how different disease labels affect attitudes toward groups associated with the label, threat perceptions, and policy preferences. Findings show that mislabeling can increase perceived threat and alter blame dynamics, with implications for social cohesion and crisis communication. The study contributes to understanding how language shapes public reactions during public health emergencies.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nResource Publicness Matters in Organizational Perceptions (2021). Public Administration Review, 82(2), 338–353. with Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPublic, nonprofit, and private organizations often rely on different combinations of funding sources, which may shape how stakeholders perceive them. This study develops and tests the concept of resource publicness and examines how funding composition influences organizational perceptions. Using experimental evidence, we show that higher resource publicness affects perceptions of legitimacy, accountability, and mission orientation. The findings advance theories of sector distinctions and provide insight into how organizations can manage stakeholder expectations through financial transparency and communication.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnpacking Nonprofit Autonomy-Interdependence Paradox in Collaborative Relationships (2021).

(2020). Health Policy OPEN, 100027. with Nathan Favero; Sebastian Jilke; Julia A. Wolfson; Matthew Young.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEffective crisis communication can depend not only on message content but also on who delivers the message. This study examines messenger effects in COVID-19 communication, focusing on whether the level of government (local, state, federal) influences public responses. Using survey experiments, we test how messenger cues shape trust, perceived credibility, and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that messenger effects vary across contexts and may interact with political attitudes. The findings inform public health communication strategies and highlight the importance of messenger selection in emergency messaging.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nThe Perceived Differences: The Sector Stereotypes of Social Service Providers (2020).

The positive effect of gender matching is not observed for both responsiveness and willingness to engage with the resident who submitted the inquiry. However, we find a modest but robust effect of gender incongruence, suggesting that managers are more willing to engage with requesters of the opposite gender once they commit to respond.\n\n\n\nDesigning a More Inclusive Government Grantmaking Process: Perspectives from Nonprofit Leaders in Minnesota. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter; Kari Aanestad.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEach year, the state of Minnesota administers hundreds of millions of dollars in the nonprofit sector via government grant programs. While nonprofits play important roles in ensuring the effective implementation of these programs and amplifying the voices of community members, they face significant barriers in the government grantmaking process. These barriers are especially challenging for small, rural, and BIPOC-serving nonprofits. Leveraging a research-practice partnership and a survey of 327 nonprofit leaders in Minnesota (78% of our nonprofit respondents have applied for or received a state government grant at least once in the past 5 years), we provide the answers to the following two questions: (1) What key barriers are nonprofits experiencing in the government grant-making process? (2) What elements of the government grant request for proposals (RFPs) impact nonprofits’ intention to apply for such programs?\n\n\n\nLinking Decision Roles to Knowledge Utilization in U.S. State Governments: A Mixed-Method Study. with Shuping Wang; Yuan-Daniel Cheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe contemporary evidence-based policymaking movement argues that we need more scientific evidence or knowledge for civil servants to make better decisions. However, how civil servants rely on different types of knowledge to make decision, and how much weight they put on each type of knowledge is not clear. Furthermore, recent discussions on street-level bureaucrats also provide insights into how personal experience can help civil servants make better decisions. Using survey data from 259 civil servants and 36 semi-structured interviews from three state governments, this article employs a mixed-method approach to understand how civil servants strategically use different knowledge to respond to different role requirements from multiple institutional logics. The results suggest that civil servants in policy, legislative relations, and budgeting roles value political knowledge more than other civil servants, while civil servants in contracting roles value personal knowledge more. No role prioritizes scientific knowledge more than the other roles. Using information from our qualitative interviews, we further discuss the reasons why civil servants in some roles value various types of knowledge more than others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Country for Model Minorities: Evidence of Discrimination Against Asian Noncitizen Immigrants in the U.S. Nursing Home Market (2025). Public Administration Review, 85(5), 1347–1364. with Danbee Lee.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAlthough public administration scholars have long been concerned about equity in public service delivery, evidence on discrimination against Asian noncitizen immigrants remains limited. Drawing on theories of social categorization and intergroup bias, this study tests whether nursing homes discriminate against Asian noncitizen applicants. We conduct a correspondence experiment in which inquiries from prospective residents vary by implied race/ethnicity and citizenship status. Results show that Asian noncitizen immigrants receive fewer and less helpful responses than comparable applicants, indicating discrimination in access to long-term care information. The findings highlight an overlooked dimension of inequity and suggest the need for oversight and policy interventions to ensure fair access to care.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEvaluating Use of Evidence in U.S. State Governments: A Conjoint Analysis (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(4), 1217–1235. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Shuping Wang; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEvidence‐based practice (EBP) has become a global movement, yet we know comparatively little about how civil servants evaluate evidence in decision making. We use a conjoint experiment embedded in a multi-state survey of state government employees to examine which features of evidence increase its perceived usefulness. Respondents evaluated short evidence summaries that randomly varied on attributes such as methodological rigor, relevance, timeliness, source credibility, and presentation format. Results show that credibility and relevance substantially shape perceived usefulness, while certain technical features have weaker or heterogeneous effects. The study clarifies what “counts” as evidence for public officials and offers practical lessons for researchers and intermediaries aiming to increase evidence uptake in government.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnderstanding the Use of Evidence-based Practices by Civil Servants in U.S. State Governments: Current State, Challenges and Pathways Forward (2024). Public Administration Review, 85(1), 9–20. with Yuan (Daniel) Cheng; Leslie Thompson; Shuping Wang; Jules Marzec; Weston Merrick; Patrick Carter.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLeveraging a three-state survey of 323 civil servants, this study examines the current state of evidence-based practice (EBP) use in state governments, identifies common barriers, and considers pathways for strengthening evidence use. We document patterns of evidence engagement across agencies and roles, highlighting constraints such as limited time, misalignment between available evidence and policy needs, and organizational factors that shape access and incentives. We also explore how training, leadership support, and institutional infrastructure relate to evidence use. Findings inform ongoing efforts to build evidence-informed policymaking capacity and suggest concrete strategies for improving the supply, accessibility, and applicability of evidence in state government contexts.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nDoes Mislabeling COVID-19 Elicit the Perception of Threat and Reduce Blame? (2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–13. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPolitical and media actors sometimes use labels for infectious diseases that emphasize geographic or ethnic associations. This study examines whether mislabeling COVID-19 influences perceived threat and attribution of blame. Using experimental survey evidence, we test how different disease labels affect attitudes toward groups associated with the label, threat perceptions, and policy preferences. Findings show that mislabeling can increase perceived threat and alter blame dynamics, with implications for social cohesion and crisis communication. The study contributes to understanding how language shapes public reactions during public health emergencies.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nResource Publicness Matters in Organizational Perceptions (2021). Public Administration Review, 82(2), 338–353. with Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPublic, nonprofit, and private organizations often rely on different combinations of funding sources, which may shape how stakeholders perceive them. This study develops and tests the concept of resource publicness and examines how funding composition influences organizational perceptions. Using experimental evidence, we show that higher resource publicness affects perceptions of legitimacy, accountability, and mission orientation. The findings advance theories of sector distinctions and provide insight into how organizations can manage stakeholder expectations through financial transparency and communication.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nMessenger Effects in COVID-19 Communication: Does the Level of Government Matter? (2020). Health Policy OPEN, 100027. with Nathan Favero; Sebastian Jilke; Julia A. Wolfson; Matthew Young.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEffective crisis communication can depend not only on message content but also on who delivers the message. This study examines messenger effects in COVID-19 communication, focusing on whether the level of government (local, state, federal) influences public responses. Using survey experiments, we test how messenger cues shape trust, perceived credibility, and behavioral intentions. Results indicate that messenger effects vary across contexts and may interact with political attitudes. The findings inform public health communication strategies and highlight the importance of messenger selection in emergency messaging.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor-Profit Fundraisers Make Nonprofits Market-Focused in Donors’ Eyes. with Kenneth Meier.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe tension between social mission and organizational efficiency in nonprofit organizations is evident in various operational practices, particularly fundraising. In pursuit of greater efficiency, some nonprofits outsource this critical function to professional fundraising consultants, who are often for-profit entities. However, prior research on sector stereotypes suggests that the public tends to view business-like or profit-seeking practices in social services negatively. Consequently, hiring for-profit fundraisers may backfire for nonprofits. We test this hypothesis through a preregistered online experiment. The results show that donor contributions did not significantly decrease when a for-profit professional fundraiser represented a nonprofit nursing home, even under an aggressive pricing strategy. However, the use of a for-profit fundraiser led participants to perceive the nonprofit as more market-oriented than the typical nonprofit. We discuss the implications of this shift in public perceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation Cost and Charitable Giving (2025). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly (Online first). with George Mitchell; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nDonors may be unwilling to acquire information about nonprofit performance when doing so is costly, potentially limiting charitable giving and weakening incentives for nonprofit accountability. This article examines how information costs shape donation decisions and evaluates whether reducing those costs increases giving. Using experimental evidence, we show that when performance information is easy to obtain, donors are more likely to consider it and adjust their giving accordingly. Conversely, higher information costs reduce attention to performance signals and attenuate responsiveness. We discuss implications for nonprofit transparency, information intermediaries, and fundraising strategies that lower donors’ search and processing burdens.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCommunal-Focused or Market-Focused: Moral Judgment on Business Practices in Nonprofit Organizations (2023). Nonprofit Management and Leadership, 34(3), 629–655.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofit organizations increasingly adopt business practices, yet such practices may elicit moral concerns because nonprofits are expected to prioritize communal goals. This study examines how observers morally judge nonprofit business practices and whether judgments depend on whether practices signal communal focus or market focus. Using survey experiments, we show that market-focused cues trigger stronger moral disapproval and reduce perceived legitimacy relative to communal-focused cues. The findings illuminate a moral dimension of nonprofit hybridity and suggest that how nonprofits communicate and frame business practices can shape stakeholder evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUnpacking Nonprofit Autonomy-Interdependence Paradox in Collaborative Relationships (2021). American Review of Public Administration, 51(4), 308–324. with Mirae Kim.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNonprofits frequently collaborate with governments and other partners, gaining resources while risking reduced autonomy. This article examines the autonomy–interdependence paradox in nonprofit collaborative relationships and identifies conditions under which collaboration undermines or supports nonprofit autonomy. Using empirical analyses, we show that different forms of dependence and governance arrangements can have distinct effects. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of collaboration tradeoffs and provide guidance for designing partnerships that balance resource benefits with nonprofit independence.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nThe Perceived Differences: The Sector Stereotypes of Social Service Providers (2020). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 49(6), 1293–1310.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nSector stereotypes can shape how people perceive social service providers and evaluate their performance, even when services are similar. This article examines stereotypes about nonprofit versus government providers and how such perceptions influence judgments. Using experimental designs, we show that sector labels can trigger systematic expectations about compassion, efficiency, and trustworthiness. These stereotypes affect support and evaluations of service outcomes. The study advances understanding of how sector identities influence public opinion and has implications for service branding, contracting, and accountability.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nPhilanthropy Can Be Learned: A Qualitative Study of Student Experiences in Experiential Philanthropy Courses (2019). Philanthropy and Education, 2(2), 29–52. with Huafang Li; Lindsey McDougle.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nExperiential philanthropy courses aim to teach students about philanthropy by involving them in real grantmaking decisions. This qualitative study examines student experiences in such courses and identifies learning outcomes and challenges. Findings suggest that students develop increased understanding of nonprofit work, donor decision making, and community needs, while also encountering tensions related to values, evidence, and accountability. The study offers insights for designing experiential philanthropy pedagogy and contributes to broader conversations about civic learning and philanthropic education.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nUsing Large Scale Social Media Experiments in Public Administration: Assessing Charitable Consequences of Government Funding to Nonprofits (2019). Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 29(4), 627–639. with Sebastian Jilke; Jiahuan Lu; Shugo Shinohara.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nGovernment funding can influence public perceptions of nonprofits and potentially affect private donations. This study uses large-scale social media experiments to examine how information about government funding to nonprofits shapes charitable behavior. We test messaging interventions and measure donation-related outcomes, assessing whether government support crowds out or crowds in private giving. Results indicate that funding cues can have meaningful effects, depending on framing and audience characteristics. The study demonstrates the promise of social media experiments for public administration research and provides evidence on the charitable consequences of government–nonprofit financial relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nComplementary or Supplementary? The Relationship between Government Size and Nonprofit Sector Size (2018). VOLUNTAS, 29(3), 454–469. with Jiahuan Lu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe relationship between government size and nonprofit sector size is debated: larger governments may either crowd out nonprofits (substitution) or foster nonprofit growth (complementarity). This article examines cross-national evidence on how government scale relates to nonprofit sector size, considering theoretical mechanisms and contextual factors. Findings suggest that government and nonprofit sectors can be complementary in many settings, though relationships vary depending on policy domains and institutional environments. The study contributes to comparative nonprofit research and informs discussions about state–civil society relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nCan Philanthropy be Taught? (2017). Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 46(2), 330–351. with Lindsey McDougle; D. McDonald; W. McIntyre Miller; Huafang Li.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nInterest in teaching philanthropy has grown, but evidence about whether and how philanthropic attitudes and behaviors can be shaped through education is limited. This article examines experiential philanthropy courses and evaluates whether participation influences students’ philanthropic knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Using empirical data, we find that experiential approaches can improve understanding and engagement, though effects vary across student groups and course designs. The study provides evidence that philanthropy can be taught and offers recommendations for philanthropic education and civic engagement pedagogy.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking Decision Roles to Knowledge Utilization in U.S. State Governments: A Mixed-Method Study. with Shuping Wang; Yuan-Daniel Cheng.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe contemporary evidence-based policymaking movement argues that we need more scientific evidence or knowledge for civil servants to make better decisions.

Policy Studies Journal). with Alexander Churchill; Shamitha Pichika; Ying Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nText annotation, the practice of labeling text following a predetermined scheme, is essential to qualitative public policy research. Despite its importance, annotating large qualitative data faces challenges of high labor and time costs. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), specifically models with generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), show a potential approach that may alleviate the burden of manual text annotation. In this report, we first introduce a small sample pretest strategy for researchers to decide whether to use Open AI’s GPT models for text annotation. In addition, we test if GPT models can substitute human coders by comparing the results of two GPT models with different prompting strategies against human annotation. Using email messages collected from a national corresponding experiment in the US nursing home market as an example, on average, we demonstrate 86.25% percentage agreement between GPT and human annotations. We also show that GPT models possess context-based limitations. Our report ends with reflections and suggestions for readers who are interested in using GPT models for text annotation.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nDe-stereotyping Public Performance Evaluation (2023). International Public Management Journal, 26(1), 107–125. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPerformance information can be interpreted through stereotypes about social groups, potentially biasing public performance evaluation. This study investigates whether and how de-stereotyping interventions affect citizens’ judgments when evaluating performance outcomes linked to stereotyped groups. Using experimental designs, we show that stereotypes can systematically shape perceived performance and support for public organizations. However, providing individuating information or reframing cues can reduce reliance on stereotypes and improve evaluative fairness. The results highlight a psychological mechanism behind biased performance assessment and point to actionable strategies to mitigate inequities in citizen evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\nEverything hacked? What is the Evidential Value of the Experimental Public Administration Literature? (2021). Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–17. with Dominik Vogel.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nConcerns about publication bias and questionable research practices have raised questions about the credibility of experimental findings across disciplines. This article evaluates the evidential value of the experimental public administration literature using statistical tools designed to detect selective reporting and assess robustness. We analyze published experiments and examine patterns of reported p-values and effect sizes. The results suggest that while many studies provide evidential value, there are also signs consistent with selective reporting in some areas. We discuss implications for research transparency and propose practices to strengthen the reliability and cumulative progress of experimental public administration research.\n\n\n\nArticle\n\n\n:::"

Using 622 emails to federal Superfund managers, we found no significant differences based on nativity or race alone. However, we discovered substantial language-based disparities: managers were 12.7 percentage points less likely to respond to emails written in Spanish compared to those in English. These findings reveal that variations in access to information and participation opportunities from government agencies are largely attributable to whether residents communicate using the dominant language in society, rather than to racial or nativity status alone. This research advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving bureaucrat-citizen interactions, with important implications for administrative capacity building in increasingly diverse communities."

It provides students with conceptual foundations they need, while also introducing them to important trends in the discipline.\nThe overarching question we will address in this class is: How politics influences public administration? The course is organized into three major themes. The first theme, “The Job of Government”, identifies the role of government in American society and the nature of public administration in such political and cultural context. More specifically, this theme covers topics including what government does and how it does it, government strategies and tactics in policy process and public service delivery, and issues of administrative responsibility.\nThe second theme of the course is “Managing Public Organization”, which probes theories underlying public organizations. It will explore the structure of the executive branch and its organizational problems that hamper its performance; it will also cover important theories of organizational behavior and expose challenges and strategies of human resource management with a special emphasis on social equity and diversity issues.\nThe final theme, “Making and Implementing Government Decisions”, will cover topics including government decision making process, and implementation and performance. Under this theme, we will focus specifically on street-level bureaucrats’ ethical decision making, unravel why good policies may lead to a major failure in the society, and how performance evaluation may or may not improve equitable and efficient public service delivery.\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\nPUBM 5100: Economic Analysis\nThis course deals with the application of basic microeconomic analysis to public policy problems. The primary goal of the course is to learn the basic principles of economic reasoning so that you can use those principles to help untangle the complex policy problems you will confront as policy makers, policy analysts, and administrators. The course differs from more traditional microeconomics courses in its emphasis on public policy applications.\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\nPUBM 5430: Research Design for Program Evaluation\nThis course exposes students to issues central to understanding and applying research-based evidence to public affairs and administration. These issues include the use of theory or models, measurement concepts and methods, qualitative and quantitative modes of observation, identifying causes, the logic of control variables, and understanding experiments and quasi-experiments. The emphasis is on learning these ideas through practice with many different examples of real-world research and empirical evidence.\n\nSkills covered:\n\nCausal diagram\nLogics of causal inference with randomized experiments and quasi-experiments\nSurvey design\nQualitative inquiries\nQualitative data analysis\nLogics of evidence-based decision making\n\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\n\nPUBM 5900: Capstone for Public Services\nThe primary objective for the course is to thoroughly research and analyze a problem or issue faced by a client organization in the public or nonprofit sectors, and to make recommendations for improvement. To ensure you have an accurate understanding of the issue being analyzed, you are required to conduct and analyze a series of interviews in preparation for their final report. You will work independently, with support from me and your peers, to select a client, identify a policy or organizational issue that impacts that client, research and analyze that issue, and make a final recommendation to your client. At the end of the quarter, you will submit a written report and present your findings and recommendations in a 10-12-minute oral presentation to a public audience.\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\nPUBM 5910: Advanced Data Analysis and Management\nPublic agencies are increasingly interested in unlocking the potential of large-scale data to improve service delivery and inform policy efforts. Computational tools capable of making productive use of big data have proliferated in recent years, drastically decreasing the barriers to entry for interested parties. This 8-week course will be divided into two following sections:\nThe first part of this course will explore the practice of using data to improve organizational performance, including techniques for data collection, analysis, and behavior change. Regression serves as the foundation for modern quantitative program evaluation techniques, so the first part of this course establishes a baseline set of skills that can be extended in your future self-studies.\nThe second part of the course focuses on effective data management for public agencies. Students will operate as their own laboratory through a data journaling exercise, and devise strategies for incorporating data into management practices of public and nonprofit organizations.\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\nPUBA 3910 (Special Topics): Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship\nOur society is calling for more solutions for growing social problems, and social enterprises—new venture creation that profitably confronts social problems such as poverty and inequality, lack of access to healthcare and education, and climate change—are considered as an innovative approach to make effective and sustainable impact. This course will enable you to build you a sense of social entrepreneurship and to inspire you ideas for social problems particularly of your interest. We will start with identifying social problems, understanding their underlying mechanisms. Then, we will explore different approaches of social innovation, including social enterprises, B-Corporations, social impact bonds, and their fundamental principles and logics. Finally, we will take a critical perspective to re-examine social enterprises to understand unique challenges against such innovative approach.\nDownload syllabus\n\n\n\nPUBA 3910 (Special Topics): Public Policy and Economics\nThis course offers a unique approach to economics by focusing on the practical application of economic principles to key policy fields. Unlike traditional economics courses that emphasize graphic and mathematical approaches, this course prioritizes the real-world application of concepts and theories to analyze and address contemporary social issues.\nStudents in this class will explore how economic insights can explain and drive social change as well as inform policy design. Through interactive discussions and debates, students will learn to evaluate economic equity, assess environmental policies, and explore the economic implications of technological innovations. Additionally, the course will cover the intricacies of U.S. housing markets and healthcare systems, equipping students with the knowledge to design effective policies in these areas.\nIn addition, this class will equip students with foundations and skills for learning economics. Class activities will heavily rely on students’ use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools (e.g. Learn About and NotebookLM by Google), including active learning, fact-checking, debates, and critical writing.\nDownload syllabus"

Journal of Behavioral Public Administration, 4(2), 1–17. with Dominik Vogel.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nConcerns about publication bias and questionable research practices have raised questions about the credibility of experimental findings across disciplines. This article evaluates the evidential value of the experimental public administration literature using statistical tools designed to detect selective reporting and assess robustness. We analyze published experiments and examine patterns of reported p-values and effect sizes. The results suggest that while many studies provide evidential value, there are also signs consistent with selective reporting in some areas. We discuss implications for research transparency and propose practices to strengthen the reliability and cumulative progress of experimental public administration research.\n\n\n\nArticle"

International Public Management Journal, 26(1), 107–125. with Yixin Liu.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPerformance information can be interpreted through stereotypes about social groups, potentially biasing public performance evaluation. This study investigates whether and how de-stereotyping interventions affect citizens’ judgments when evaluating performance outcomes linked to stereotyped groups. Using experimental designs, we show that stereotypes can systematically shape perceived performance and support for public organizations. However, providing individuating information or reframing cues can reduce reliance on stereotypes and improve evaluative fairness. The results highlight a psychological mechanism behind biased performance assessment and point to actionable strategies to mitigate inequities in citizen evaluations.\n\n\n\nArticle"

This article examines stereotypes about nonprofit versus government providers and how such perceptions influence judgments. Using experimental designs, we show that sector labels can trigger systematic expectations about compassion, efficiency, and trustworthiness. These stereotypes affect support and evaluations of service outcomes. The study advances understanding of how sector identities influence public opinion and has implications for service branding, contracting, and accountability.\n\n\n\nArticle"

This study uses large-scale social media experiments to examine how information about government funding to nonprofits shapes charitable behavior. We test messaging interventions and measure donation-related outcomes, assessing whether government support crowds out or crowds in private giving. Results indicate that funding cues can have meaningful effects, depending on framing and audience characteristics. The study demonstrates the promise of social media experiments for public administration research and provides evidence on the charitable consequences of government–nonprofit financial relationships.\n\n\n\nArticle"

However, how civil servants rely on different types of knowledge to make decision, and how much weight they put on each type of knowledge is not clear. Furthermore, recent discussions on street-level bureaucrats also provide insights into how personal experience can help civil servants make better decisions. Using survey data from 259 civil servants and 36 semi-structured interviews from three state governments, this article employs a mixed-method approach to understand how civil servants strategically use different knowledge to respond to different role requirements from multiple institutional logics. The results suggest that civil servants in policy, legislative relations, and budgeting roles value political knowledge more than other civil servants, while civil servants in contracting roles value personal knowledge more. No role prioritizes scientific knowledge more than the other roles. Using information from our qualitative interviews, we further discuss the reasons why civil servants in some roles value various types of knowledge more than others."

This article examines the autonomy–interdependence paradox in nonprofit collaborative relationships and identifies conditions under which collaboration undermines or supports nonprofit autonomy. Using empirical analyses, we show that different forms of dependence and governance arrangements can have distinct effects. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of collaboration tradeoffs and provide guidance for designing partnerships that balance resource benefits with nonprofit independence.\n\n\n\nArticle"

We document patterns of evidence engagement across agencies and roles, highlighting constraints such as limited time, misalignment between available evidence and policy needs, and organizational factors that shape access and incentives. We also explore how training, leadership support, and institutional infrastructure relate to evidence use. Findings inform ongoing efforts to build evidence-informed policymaking capacity and suggest concrete strategies for improving the supply, accessibility, and applicability of evidence in state government contexts.\n\n\n\nArticle"

Our nationwide audit shows that while Black and White constituents receive similar baseline responsiveness from local policymakers, cues about institutional conditions in constituent messages can reconfigure who gets attention and whether attention becomes commitment. Appeals to broad public concern can open doors for Black constituents yet simultaneously steer policymakers away from substantive engagement. We demonstrate this dynamic in police misconduct settlements—quiet payouts that strain municipal budgets and bypass police accountability. Yet the mechanisms we uncover should travel beyond policing. By showing how micro-level race-based gatekeeping is conditioned by macro-level institutional conditions, we highlight both the promise and peril of public pressure as a strategy to broaden minority access to policy agenda."

This article examines how information costs shape donation decisions and evaluates whether reducing those costs increases giving. Using experimental evidence, we show that when performance information is easy to obtain, donors are more likely to consider it and adjust their giving accordingly. Conversely, higher information costs reduce attention to performance signals and attenuate responsiveness. We discuss implications for nonprofit transparency, information intermediaries, and fundraising strategies that lower donors’ search and processing burdens.\n\n\n\nArticle"

While nonprofits play important roles in ensuring the effective implementation of these programs and amplifying the voices of community members, they face significant barriers in the government grantmaking process. These barriers are especially challenging for small, rural, and BIPOC-serving nonprofits. Leveraging a research-practice partnership and a survey of 327 nonprofit leaders in Minnesota (78% of our nonprofit respondents have applied for or received a state government grant at least once in the past 5 years), we provide the answers to the following two questions: (1) What key barriers are nonprofits experiencing in the government grant-making process? (2) What elements of the government grant request for proposals (RFPs) impact nonprofits’ intention to apply for such programs?"
