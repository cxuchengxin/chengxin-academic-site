Interest in teaching philanthropy has grown, but evidence about whether and how philanthropic attitudes and behaviors can be shaped through education is limited. This article examines experiential philanthropy courses and evaluates whether participation influences students’ philanthropic knowledge, attitudes, and intentions. Using empirical data, we find that experiential approaches can improve understanding and engagement, though effects vary across student groups and course designs. The study provides evidence that philanthropy can be taught and offers recommendations for philanthropic education and civic engagement pedagogy.
