Experiential philanthropy courses aim to teach students about philanthropy by involving them in real grantmaking decisions. This qualitative study examines student experiences in such courses and identifies learning outcomes and challenges. Findings suggest that students develop increased understanding of nonprofit work, donor decision making, and community needs, while also encountering tensions related to values, evidence, and accountability. The study offers insights for designing experiential philanthropy pedagogy and contributes to broader conversations about civic learning and philanthropic education.
